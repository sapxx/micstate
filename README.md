# micstate
A mini-application for those who don't have a mute button on the microphone. Nothing special, just tired of climbing into mmsys.cpl :)
>it's very simple, this app binds to the state of the Scroll Lock. If ScrollLock ON -> your mic is on; If ScrollLock OFF -> your mic is off. To understand the current state of the microphone, you can look in the tray or / and on your keyboard led 

Used nuget:
NAudio - wasapi;
ScottPlot - wave visualizer;
